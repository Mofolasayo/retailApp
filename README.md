# retail_app

In this Flutter application, I have implemented a feature that allows users to retrieve retail products from the Timbu API and present them in a scrollable list. Each product entry holds various information such as the name, description, price, and images, providing users with a comprehensive view of the available items. This application serves as a practical example of utilizing APIs, parsing JSON data, and exhibiting the results using Flutter widgets.
